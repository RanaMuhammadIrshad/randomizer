# Randomizer

## Create a program (use function declarations) that will schedule some random tasks.

E.g.
- chilling on Saturday
- dentist on Tuesday
- chilling on Tuesday
- coding on Friday
- dentist on Saturday
- travelling on Sunday
- volunteering on Wednesday

### As you can notice, days and tasks do not have to be unique at this point.
### Activities need to be printed to the console.
### The user can decide how many activities they want to print (it could be just 1 line ore more).
### Each function should perform 1 specific job. 
### You should create around 4 functions.
### Use comments to describe your thinking process.
